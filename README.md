## IMPORTANT NOTE
If you scared to use program due virus detection, then i'd recommend to not run it on main PC, because it will break windows until next restart so keep it in mindðŸ¤«
Program was tested on real machine and in VM, all features is working

## FAQ

#### I going to use task manager lol! uh.. WHY IT NOT WORK?

Hydra 2.0 automatically checks for tasks, and if it detects task manager Hydra will just block it.

#### Ok, Then how can i remove it?

Simple as never, just restart your PC.


## Installation

As requirement you need to have Python installed, well sometimes its not important because when i was checking it in tria.ge it was still working.
